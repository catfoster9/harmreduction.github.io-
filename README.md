# Harm Reduction Website

I designed and developed this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in July 2021 as my final project during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. My goal is to educate about harm reduction, which is an approach to addressing the drug-overdose epidemic. 

The site includes background information about harm reduction, an interactive fact generator about the opioid overdose crisis, a library of links to resources, and more. For the design of the website, I prototypes wireframes, selected bright colors that act as a call to action to the user, and created a logo. I used Flexbox and media queries to create a responsive and seamless user experience.
