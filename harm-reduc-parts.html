    <div class="strategiesContainer">
      <img class="strategyPic" src="assets/waitingroom.jpeg" alt="Chairs in a hospital waiting room">
      <p class="strategyText">Using drugs alone is dangerous, especially with the contaminated drug supply, because there is no one around to help or call 911 in case of an overdose or other complication. Supervised Consumption Sites are places where people can use drugs under supervision (i.e. many sites have medical professionals) so that their health and safety is monitored. </p>

    <h3 class="strategyHeader">Needle Exchanges</h3>

    <!--Flexbox for Needle Exchanges image and text-->
    <div class="strategiesContainer">
      <img class="strategyPic" src="assets/discarded-needles.jpeg" alt="Garbage such as bottles and discarded needles lying in dirt">
      <p class="strategyText">Injection drug use is linked to hundreds of thousands of cases of HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis B and C in the US. Swapping contaminated needles for sterile needles is essential for reducing transmission of these diseases and preserving the health of people who use drugs.</p>

    <h3 class="strategyHeader">Drug Checks</h3>

    <!--Flexbox for Drug Checks image and text-->
    <div class="strategiesContainer">
      <img class="strategyPic" src="assets/white-pills.jpeg" alt="White pills scattered on a blue background">
      <p class="strategyText">When people purchase illicit drugs, they have no way of knowing if the drug is actually the substance they think they are purchasing. For example, lots of heroin now contains fentanyl, so if someone uses their usual dose of heroin from a contaminated batch, they may overdose because fentanyl is much more potent than heroin. Drug checks help users learn the true contents of their drugs, allowing them to make an educated decision on whether or not to use the drug and what dose to use.</p>

    <h3 class="strategyHeader">Decriminalization and Legalization</h3>

    <!--Flexbox for Decrim and Legalize image and text-->
    <div class="strategiesContainer">
      <img class="strategyPic" src="assets/social-justice.jpeg" alt="People protesting with signs saying Time for Change">
      <p class="strategyText">Decriminalization combats mass incarceration and makes drug use safer because people caught with small amounts of drugs do not get arrested. It also allows funds from incarceration and policing to be redirected to addiction treatment and other harm reduction services. Legalization goes even further because it creates a regulated and safer supply of drugs, helping to remove the danger of contaminated drugs.</p>

    <h3 class="strategyHeader">Access to Naloxone</h3>

    <!--Flexbox for naloxone image and text-->
    <div class="strategiesContainer">
      <img class="strategyPic" src="assets/save-lives.png" alt="Road sign that says Save Lives">
      <p class="strategyText">Naloxone (brand name of the nasal spray version is Narcan) is a drug that reverses opioid overdoses. Harm reductionists encourage people to never use drugs alone so that someone is around to administer naloxone and seek emergency help in case of an opioid overdose. This drug saves lives, so making it more accessible is essential. See the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page for a tutorial on how to administer all types of naloxone (everyone should learn!) and links to free naloxone distributors. </p>
