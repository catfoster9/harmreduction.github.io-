      <!--Question header-->
      <h3>What is harm reduction?</h3>

      <!--Answer to the question header - info about harm reduction-->
      <p class="aboutHR">Harm reduction is a strategy for preventing overdoses and making drug use as safe as possible. Key parts of harm reduction include needle exchanges, drug checks, supervised consumption spaces, and drug decriminalization or legalization advocacy. Learn more about these on the <a href="harm-reduc-parts.html">Parts of Harm Reduction</a> page. <br> <br> At the heart of the harm reduction philosophy is recognition of the dignity and value of people who use drugs and regard for their rights --- principles missing from our current drug policy. Harm reduction focuses on allowing people who use drugs to choose paths that they feel are best for them and making it safe for them to do so.</p>

      <!--Question header-->
      <h3>Why harm reduction?</h3>

      <!--Answer to the question header - info about why harm reduction is good-->
      <p class="aboutHR">Many harm reductionists believe that every accidental overdose death is preventable and the result of policy failure. Our current policy of criminalization prevents drug users from accessing a safe supply of drugs, perpetuates poverty, and contributes to racism and classism. Harm reduction attempts to remedy some of this damage caused by our harmful policy, making it a vital part of the fight for racial and economic justice. Learn more about drug policy and the overdose crisis on <a href="issue.html">The Issue</a> page.  <br> <br> Additionally, humans have always experimented with drugs, even in ancient times. It is inevitable, and it is not practical to attempt to remove all drug use from society. Instead, our goal should be to make substance use as safe as possible. Thatâ€™s where harm reduction can help. </p>
